Years ago, *** ***'s tavern BROUGHT THIS TOWN TOGETHER. TODAY, WE'RE BRINGING HIS TAVERN BACK TO LIFE.
back in mid-1800s, *** *** built a tavern and grocery story at what's now the corner of peachtree road and east paces ferry. his establishment quickly became a popular watering hole for locals as we as travellers - so much so that the are becam known as ***ville. one day, according to legend, a hunter proudly hung a buck's head on a post outside of the tavern. people began using this as a landmark, telling friends to meet up at the buck's head. ultimatelythe name struck and Buckhead was born.
